### GRANT STEINFELD

Hi, I'm Grant.

I am a Software Engineer, passionate about technology, in particular, Design, Architecture, Data, Automation and Cloud Engineering.

Learning new and challenging things everyday is for me a fundamental part of my life. I love to share
my learnings, mentorship and co-creating magic in collaborative settings is one of my core values.

I love to design, architect systems and frameworks throughout the entire sofware
development life-cycle. Fanatic proponent of adopting OpenSource, Containers, Test Driven Development and
Infrastructure as Code ecosystems, allowing one to continuously build and deploy world class Cloud Native software.

I am an avid Maker and love to conduct hack/make-a-thons. e.g. [Pi Build Monitor](./bio-cv-etc/Sentinella.md)

I have been coding for over two decades, and
been speaking for almost half of that. I speak all over to whomever will
listen. I design, architect, code, empower, document and listen and learn, I am engaged and engaging - often not in that exact sequence.
